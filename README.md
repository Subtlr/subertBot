# This is my first actual project.
Why did i choose this as my first project? Well, it's because I use discord a lot and I've always been fascinated with discord bots, so I took sometime to learn discord.py and made this, have fun! :D

## How to set up this bot on your bot?
1. Clone the Repository
First, download the bot’s source code from GitHub using Git.
2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Move into the bot’s folder where its files are stored.
3. Install Dependencies
Ensure all required Python libraries are installed.
Run this command on the terminal: ```pip install discord python-dotenv wikipedia requests```
5. Create a .env File
Set up an environment file to securely store the bot token and other sensitive configurations.
6. Obtain a Discord Bot Token
Go to the Discord Developer Portal, create a bot, and copy its token.
7. Add Your Token to .env
Paste the bot token inside the .env file so the bot can authenticate when running.
8. Run the Bot
Execute the bot script to start the bot and connect it to Discord.

## This is just a fun personal projects, nothing is serious!
